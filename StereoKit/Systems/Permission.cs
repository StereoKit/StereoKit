	/// sensitive data like eye gaze, or objects in the user's room. This is
	/// often complicated by the fact that permissions aren't standardized
	/// across XR runtimes, making these permissions fragile and a pain to work
	/// with.
	/// 
	/// This class attempts to manage feature permissions in a nice
	/// cross-platform manner that handles runtime specific differences. You
	/// will still need to add permission strings to your app's metadata file
	/// (like AndroidManifest.xml), but this class will handle figuring out
	/// which strings in the metadata to actually use.
	/// 
	/// On platforms that don't use permissions, like Win32 or Linux, these
	/// functions will behave as though everything is granted automatically.
