	/// <summary>A Matrix in StereoKit is a 4x4 grid of numbers that is used 
	/// to represent a transformation for any sort of position or vector! 
	/// This is an oversimplification of what a matrix actually is, but it's
	/// accurate in this case.
	/// 
	/// Matrices are really useful for transforms because you can chain 
	/// together all sorts of transforms into a single Matrix! A Matrix
	/// transform really shines when applied to many positions, as the more
	/// expensive operations get cached within the matrix values.
	///
	/// Multiple matrix transforms can be combined by multiplying them. In StereoKit, 
    /// to create a matrix that first scales an object, followed by rotating it, and 
    /// finally translating it you would use this order: 
    /// Matrix M = Matrix.S(...) * Matrix.R(...) * Matrix.T(...);
    /// This order is related to the fact that StereoKit uses row-major order
    /// to store matrices. Note that in other 3D frameworks and certain 3D math 
    /// references you may find column-major matrices, which would need the reverse 
    /// order (i.e. T*R*S), so please keep this in mind when creating transformations.
    ///
	/// Matrices are prominently used within shaders for mesh transforms!
