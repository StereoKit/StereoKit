	/// <summary>A Sprite is an image that's set up for direct 2D rendering,
	/// without using a mesh or model! This is technically a wrapper over a
	/// texture, but it also includes atlasing functionality, which can be
	/// pretty important to performance! This is used a lot in UI, for image
	/// rendering.
	/// 
	/// Atlasing is not currently implemented, it'll swap to Single for now.
	/// But here's how it works!
	/// 
	/// StereoKit will batch your sprites into an atlas if you ask it to!
	/// This puts all the images on a single texture to significantly reduce
	/// draw calls when many images are present. Any time you add a sprite to
	/// an atlas, it'll be marked as dirty and rebuilt at the end of the
	/// frame. So it can be a good idea to add all your images to the atlas
	/// on initialize rather than during execution!
	/// 
	/// Since rendering is atlas based, you also have only one material per
	/// atlas. So this is why you might wish to put a sprite in one atlas or
	/// another, so you can apply different</summary>
