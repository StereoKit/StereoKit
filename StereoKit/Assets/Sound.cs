	/// On HoloLens 2, sounds are automatically processed on the HPU, freeing
	/// up the CPU for more of your app's code. To simulate this same effect
	/// on your development PC, you need to enable spatial sound on your
	/// audio endpoint. To do this, right click the speaker icon in your
	/// system tray, navigate to "Spatial sound", and choose "Windows Sonic
	/// for Headphones." For more information, visit
