	/// Anchor, or the Facebook Spatial Entity. If a proper anchoring system
	/// isn't present on the device, StereoKit will fall back to a stage-

	/// adjusts their stage frequently.

	/// A conceptual guide to Anchors:
	/// - A cloud anchor is an Anchor
	/// - A QR code is _not_ an Anchor (it's physical)
	/// - That spot around where your coffee usually sits can be an Anchor
	/// - A semantically labeled floor plane is _not_ an Anchor (it's physical)
