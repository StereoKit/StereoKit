	/// inherently one or the other, but most color values we work with tend
	/// to be gamma space colors, so most functions in StereoKit are gamma
	/// space. There are occasional functions that will ask for linear space
	/// colors instead, primarily in performance critical places, or places
	/// where a color may not always be a color! However, performing math on
	/// gamma space colors is bad, and will result in incorrect colors. We do
	/// our best to indicate what color space a function uses, but it's not
	/// enforced through syntax!</summary>
