/// # Tools and Extensions
/// 
/// Here's a list of known tools designed to work with or extend StereoKit! If
/// you've got something you'd like to see listed here, please file an Issue on
/// the GitHub repository, we'd love to see it!
/// 
/// ## [NuGet] - Official - [StereoKit.HolographicRemoting](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit.HolographicRemoting)
/// 
/// This NuGet package is an implementation of HoloLens' Holographic Remoting
/// for StereoKit! This is an easy way to get desktop functionality onto your
/// HoloLens, or cut down on iteration time while testing on-device.
/// 
/// ## [GitHub] - Official (WIP) - [StereoKit Browser](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit-Browser)
/// 
/// This is a short StereoKit sample that shows implementing a browser UI
/// widget using CefSharp!
/// 
/// ## [GitHub] - [StereoKit Tools Collection](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit/tree/master/Examples/StereoKitTest/Tools)
/// 
/// A small collection of `IStepper` tools and utilities for StereoKit.
/// 
/// ## [GitHub] - [StereoKit Light Bake](https://github.com/maluoi/SKLightBake)
/// 
/// This is a quick demo for performantly managing static scenes, and baking
/// lighting into them with StereoKit! This bakes lighting into the vertex
/// colors of the mesh, so is visually limited by the number of vertices the
/// mesh has, and will merge meshes together.
/// 
/// ## [GitHub] - [Desktop Duplicator Template](https://github.com/maluoi/SKDesktopDuplicator)
/// 
/// Mirroring a Windows desktop window and displaying it in StereoKit. Useful
/// for developing in-context. This template also includes Holographic Remoting
/// to work on HoloLens as well.
