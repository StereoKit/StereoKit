/// :CodeDoc: Guides 2 Learning Resources
/// # Learning Resources
/// 
/// Outside of the resources here on the StereoKit site, there's a number of
/// other places you can go for learning information! Here's a collection of 
/// external learning and sample resources to get you off the ground a little
/// faster! If you have your own resources that you'd like to see linked 
/// here, just let us know!
/// 
/// ## Official Sample Projects
/// 
/// ### [StereoKit Ink](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit-PaintTutorial)
/// 
/// ![StereoKit Ink]({{site.screen_url}}/StereoKitInk.jpg)
/// 
/// A well documented repository that illustrates creating a complete but 
/// simplified inking application. It includes functionality like custom and
/// standard UI, line rendering, file save/load, and hand menus.
/// 
/// ### [Bing Maps API and Terrain Sample](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit-BingMaps)
/// 
/// ![Bing Maps API and Terrain Sample]({{site.screen_url}}/SKMapsTutorial.jpg)
/// 
/// A well documented repository showing how to load and display satellite 
/// imagery and elevation information from the Bing Maps API. It includes
/// creating a terrain system using StereoKit's shader API, loading color and
/// height data from an external API, and building a pedestal interface to
/// interact with the content.
/// 
/// ### [Release Notes Demo for v0.3.1](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKitReleaseNotes/tree/main/v0.3.1)
/// 
/// This is an interactive release notes demo project that showcases the
/// features released in StereoKit v0.3.1! Not every release has a demo like
/// this, but it can be pretty enlightening to browse through a code-base
/// such as this one for reference.
/// 
/// ### [StereoKit Demos]({{site.url}}/Pages/Guides/Sample-Code.html)
/// 
/// These are the demos that test StereoKit features and APIs! They are
/// occasionally documented, but frequently short and concise. They can be
/// great to check out for a focused example of certain parts of the API!
/// 
/// ## Community Projects
/// 
/// ### [Nakamir - Azure Active Directory Auth](https://github.com/Nakamir-Code/AzureStereoKitUWPSamples)
/// 
/// This repo contains a StereoKit sample application (for Microsoft HoloLens 
/// 2) that demonstrates user authentication using Microsoft Azure Active
/// Directory.
/// 
/// ### [brunoshine - Azure Spatial Anchors](https://github.com/brunoshine/StereoKit.Samples.AzureSpatialAnchors)
/// 
/// This is a demo application on how to use Azure Spatial Anchors with
/// StereoKit to persist world anchors between sessions and devices.
/// 
/// ### [Marc Plogas - Azure Spatial Anchors](https://github.com/mplogas/stereokit.azure.spatialanchors)
/// 
/// Another ASA demo from Microsoft Cloud Advocate, Mark Plogas.
/// 
/// ### [Nakamir](https://github.com/Nakamir-Code/SKRiggedHandVisualizer) and [ClonedPuppy](https://github.com/ClonedPuppy/SKHands) - Rigged Hands
/// 
/// Attaching a skinned mesh/model to StereoKit's hand joint data.
/// 
/// ## Sites and Places
/// 
/// ### [GitHub Discussions/Issues](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit/discussions)
/// 
/// The best place to ask a question! It's asynchronous, and a great place
/// for long-form answers that can also benefit others. The Discussions tab
/// is best for questions, feedback, and more nebulous stuff, and the Issues
/// tab is best if you think something might be misbehaving or missing!
/// 
/// ### [The StereoKit Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/jtZpfS7nyK)
/// 
/// In a rush with a question, got a project to share, or just want to hang
/// out and chat? Or maybe you're looking for some feedback on a potential
/// contribution? Whatever the case, come and say hi on the Discord! This is
/// the core hang-out spot for the team and community :)
