# Building StereoKit

If you're here because you want to use StereoKit to create something, then you might be a lot more interested in the [Getting Started Guide](https://stereokit.net/Pages/Guides/Getting-Started.html)! Most developers do _not_ need to build StereoKit from the repository.

However, here's a few guidelines for people who do need to build this repository!

## I just want to run the test project!

The test project is pretty spiffy, and it can be nice to see it in action! There's a super easy way to run this by itself from the `/master` branch. Just load up [StereoKitTestNuGet.csproj](https://github.com/maluoi/StereoKit/blob/master/Examples/StereoKitTest/StereoKitTestNuGet.csproj) instead of the entire StereoKit solution! This uses the latest pre-built NuGet package, so you won't have to worry about navigating StereoKit's dependencies.

## I want to modify code (Windows)

StereoKit is a cross-platform library, but many features are not platform specific! If you don't need to test on a platform other than Windows, then you only need some of the dependencies.

**Requisites:**
- Visual Studio 2022
    - VS Workload: Universal Windows Platform
    - VS Workload: Desktop development with C++
    - VS Workload: Game development with C++
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) (To build OpenXR & dependencies)

Open StereoKit.sln and _unload_ these projects
- StereoKitTest_Android
- StereoKitCTest_Android

Set StereoKitTest as the startup project, set the platform to x64, and you should be able to build it and run! On the first build, StereoKit will also clone and build `openxr_loader` as well as `ReactPhysics3D` using a [powershell script](https://github.com/maluoi/StereoKit/blob/master/Tools/Update-OpenXR.ps1) and cmake, so this will take some extra time.

## I want to modify code (Android)

In addition to the Windows steps, to build for Android, StereoKit uses [xmake](https://xmake.io/). You will need to install it and configure it for building Android applications. You will probably need to tell it where the Android SDK is on your system. I've technically done this at least once, but don't remember it well enough to write a good guide on it.

I may update this guide eventually, but if you can track what steps you take while doing this and submit a PR, that would be really incredible!

General Setup steps:
1. Install xmake
2. Install the Android NDK. Grab the latest version from [here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) and unzip into a folder, a path without spaces will make life easier (C:\tools\Android\android-sdk)
3. Set the NDK path into xmake. This command sets the global config: `xmake g --ndk="C:\tools\Android\android-sdk\android-ndk-rXYZ"`

## I want to modify code (Linux)

StereoKit official Linux builds currently use xmake running on Windows Subsystems for Linux, however, it's also possible to use cmake, and do either from a normal Linux machine.

Here's the pre-reqs you'll need first!
```
# here's the commands for installing Linux build pre-reqs:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake unzip libfontconfig1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libvulkan-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-dri2-0-dev libxcb-glx0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev mesa-common-dev libjsoncpp-dev libxfixes-dev libglew-dev
```

To build with xmake:
```
# StereoKit uses xmake, check their docs (https://xmake.io/#/getting_started)
# for details, but here's the quick way to install:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://xmake.io/shget.text)

### From StereoKit's root directory ###

# Configure the xmake build
xmake f -p linux -a x64 --tests=y -y
# Build
xmake

# For WSL, run the test app with the software renderer
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 xmake run

# For Linux, just run like normal
xmake run
```

To build with cmake:
```
### From StereoKit's root directory ###

# Make a folder to build in
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure the build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
# Build
cmake --build . -j8 --config Debug

# Run the test app
./StereoKitCTest
```

## I want to build the whole NuGet package

The NuGet package build pipeline requires all the setup steps from above first! After that, you just need to run the [build powershell script](https://github.com/maluoi/StereoKit/blob/master/Build-Nuget.ps1). This script will build all binary variants, run tests, and track some statistics.
