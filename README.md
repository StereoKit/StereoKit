StereoKit is an easy-to-use open source mixed reality library for building HoloLens and VR applications with C# and OpenXR! Inspired by libraries like XNA and Processing, StereoKit is meant to be fun to use and easy to develop with, yet still quite capable of creating professional and business ready software.

The getting started guide [can be found here](https://stereokit.net/Pages/Guides/Getting-Started.html)!

- Texture formats: .jpg, .png, .tga, .bmp, .psd, .gif, .hdr, .pic, .qoi, cubemaps
- Flexible shader/material system with built-in PBR
- Performance-by-default instanced render pipeline
- Skeletal/skinned animation
- Flat screen MR simulator with input emulation for easy development
- Builds your application to device in seconds, not minutes
- Runtime asset loading and cross-platform file picking

- [Documentation](https://stereokit.net/) generated directly from the source code, including screenshots

## Platform Support

StereoKit supports HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Desktop, SteamVR, Varjo, Monado, and essentially everywhere OpenXR is!

These are the binaries that currently ship in the NuGet package. StereoKit developers working from C/C++ should be fine to build any architecture from this list of platforms.

| Platform | x86 | x64 | ARM | ARM64 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Windows (Desktop/Win32) |      | X |   |   |
| Windows (HoloLens/UWP)  |      | X | X | X |
| Linux                   |      | X |   | X |
| Android                 |      |   |   | X |
| Web (WASM)              | Soon |   |   |   |

Architecture support has focused on 64 bit architectures, with exceptions for certain platforms. (If you require an additional architecture in the NuGet, please propose it as an Issue!) Here, UWP's ARM builds much faster than UWP's ARM64, and WASM only comes in 32 bit flavors.

## Getting started

Follow [this guide](https://stereokit.net/Pages/Guides/Getting-Started.html) for a detailed introduction! This repository is the raw source for those who wish to build StereoKit themselves, the Visual Studio templates and the NuGet packages referenced in the guide are how most people should build their applications!

StereoKit focuses on getting you productive with the least amount of code possible. You can actually do most tasks with a single line of code, including UI! Here's hello world with StereoKit, this is all you need to get up and running!

```CSharp
using StereoKit;

SK.Initialize(new SKSettings{ appName = "Project" });

Model helmet = Model.FromFile("Assets/DamagedHelmet.gltf");

SK.Run(() => {
    helmet.Draw(Matrix.TS(Vec3.Zero, 0.1f));
});
```

## Building or Contributing

For those that wish to build the test project, or perhaps the whole library, there's a [guide to building StereoKit's repository](/BUILDING.md)! For those that wish to contribute features or fixes to StereoKit, awesome! Check out the [contributor's guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md). In addition, you may want to check with the maintainers on either GitHub Issues or the Discord channel to help make sure contributions meet the project's standards.

## Dependencies

Just like all software, StereoKit is built on the shoulders of incredible people! Here's a list of the libraries StereoKit uses to get things done.

- [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/)
- [ReactPhysics3D](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/) - physics
- [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) - gltf format support
- [Sean Barrett's stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - image and font format support
- [QOI](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi) - image format support
- [miniaudio](https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio) - audio playback
- [sokol_time](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) - cross platform high performance time
- [TinyCThread](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread) - for portable threading

And some of my own libraries that I maintain separately from this repository.

- [sk_gpu.h](https://github.com/StereoKit/sk_gpu) - cross platform graphics API
- [ferr_hash.h](https://github.com/maluoi/header-libs) - string and data hashing
- [array.h](https://github.com/maluoi/header-libs) - dynamic arrays
