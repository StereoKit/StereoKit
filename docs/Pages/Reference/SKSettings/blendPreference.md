description: What type of background blend mode do we prefer for this application? Are you trying to build an Opaque/Immersive/VR app, or would you like the display to be AnyTransparent, so the world will show up behind your content, if that's an option? Note that this is a preference only, and if it's not available on this device, the app will fall back to the runtime's preference instead! By default, (DisplayBlend.None) this uses the runtime's preference.
