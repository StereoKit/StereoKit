# enum UIPad

This specifies a particular padding mode for certain UI
elements, such as the UI.Panel! This describes where padding is applied
and how it affects the layout of elements.

## Enum Values

|  |  |
|--|--|
|Inside|This applies padding inside the element's layout bounds, and will inflate the layout bounds to fit the extra padding.|
|None|No padding, this matches the element's layout bounds exactly!|
|Outside|This will apply the padding outside of the layout bounds! This will maintain the size and position of the layout volume, but the visual padding will go outside of the volume.|
