description: 16 bits of depth is not a lot, but it can be enough if your far clipping plane is pretty close. If you're seeing lots of flickering where two objects overlap, you either need to bring your far clip in, or switch to 32/24 bit depth.

## Description
16 bits of depth is not a lot, but it can be enough if
your far clipping plane is pretty close. If you're seeing lots of
flickering where two objects overlap, you either need to bring
your far clip in, or switch to 32/24 bit depth.
