# Drawing content with StereoKit

Generally, the first thing you want to do is get content on-screen! Or
in-visor? However it's said, in this guide we're going to explore the
various ways to display some holograms!

At its core, drawing things in 3D is done through a combination of
[`Mesh`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh.html)es and
[`Material`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Material.html)s. A Mesh
is a collection of triangles in 3D space that describe where the
surface of that 3D object is. And a Material is then a collection
of parameters, [`Tex`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Tex.html)tures
(2d images), and Shader code that are combined to describe the
visual properties of the Mesh's surface!

![Meshes are made from triangles!]({{site.screen_url}}/Drawing_MeshLooksLike.jpg)
_Meshes are made from triangles!_

And in addition to that, you'll need to know a little bit about
matrices, which are a math construct used to describe the location,
orientation and scale of geometry within the 3D space! A [`Matrix`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Matrix.html)
isn't difficult the way we're using it, so don't worry if math
isn't your thing.

And then StereoKit also has a [`Model`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Model.html),
which is a high level combination of Meshes, Material, Matrices,
and a few more things! Most of the time, you'll probably be drawing
Models loaded from file, but it's important to have options.

Then lastly, StereoKit has easy systems for drawing [`Line`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Lines.html)s,
[`Text`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Text.html), [`Sprite`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Sprite.html)s
and various other things! These are still based on Meshes and
Materials under the hood, but have some complex features that can
make them difficult to build from scratch.

## Meshes and Materials

To simplify things here, we're going to use the built-in assets,
[`Mesh.Sphere`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/Sphere.html)
and [`Material.Default`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Material/Default.html).
Mesh.Sphere is a built-in mesh generated using math when StereoKit
starts up, and Material.Default is a high performance simple
Material that serves as StereoKit's default Material. (For more
built-in assets, see the [`Default`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Default.html)s)

```csharp
Mesh.Sphere.Draw(Material.Default, Matrix.Identity);
```

![Default sphere and material]({{site.screen_url}}/Drawing_Defaults.jpg)
_Drawing the default sphere Mesh with the default Material._

[`Matrix.Identity`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Matrix/Identity.html)
can be though of as a 'No transform' Matrix, so this is drawing the
sphere at the origin of the 3D space.

That's pretty straightforward! StereoKit will get this Mesh/Material
pair onto the screen this frame. Remember that StereoKit is
generally an immediate mode API, so this won't show up for more
than the current frame. If you want it to draw every frame, you'll
have to call Draw every frame!

So how do you get a Mesh to begin with? In most cases you'll just
be working with Models, but you can get a Mesh directly from a few
places:
 - [`Mesh.Sphere`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/Sphere.html), [`Mesh.Cube`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/Cube.html), and [`Mesh.Quad`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/Quad.html) are built-in mesh assets that are handy to have around.
 - [`Mesh`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh.html) has a number of static methods for generating procedural shapes, such as [`Mesh.GenerateRoundedCube`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/GenerateRoundedCube.html) or [`Mesh.GeneratePlane`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/GeneratePlane.html).
 - A Mesh can be extracted from one of a [Model's nodes]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/ModelNode/Mesh.html).
 - You can create a Mesh from a list of vertices and indices. This is more advanced, but [check the sample here]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Mesh/SetVerts.html).

And where do you get a Material? Well,
 - See built-in Materials like [`Material.PBR`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Default/MaterialPBR.html) for high-quality surface or [`Material.Unlit`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Default/MaterialUnlit.html) for fast/stylistic surfaces.
 - A Material [constructor]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Material/Material.html) can be called with a Shader. Check out [the Material guide]({{site.url}}/Pages/Guides/Working-with-Materials.html) for in-depth usage (Materials and Shaders are a lot of fun!).
 - You can call [`Material.Copy`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Material/Copy.html) to create a duplicate of an existing Material.

## Matrix basics

If you like math, this explanation is not really for you! But if
you like results, this will get you going where you need to go. The
important thing to know about a [`Matrix`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Matrix.html),
is that it's a good way to represent an object's transform (Translation,
Rotation, and Scale).

StereoKit provides a number of Matrix creation methods that allow
you to easily create Translation/Rotation/Scale matrices.
```csharp
// The identity matrix is the matrix equivalent of '1'. You can also
// think of it as a 'no-transform' matrix.
Matrix transform = Matrix.Identity;

// Translates points 1 meter up the Y axis
transform = Matrix.T(0, 1, 0);

// Scales a point by (2,2,2), rotates it 180 on the X axis, and
// then translates it up 1 meter up the Y axis.
transform = Matrix.TRS(
	new Vec3(0,1,0),
	Quat.FromAngles(180, 0, 0),
	new Vec3(2,2,2));

// To draw a cube at (0,-10,0) that's rotated 45 degrees around its Y
// axis:
Mesh.Cube.Draw(Material.Default, Matrix.TR(0,-10,0, Quat.FromAngles(0,45,0)));
```

The TRS methods have a lot of permutations that can help make your
matrix creation code a bit shorter. Like, if you don't need to add
scale to your TRS matrix, there's the TR variant! No rotation? Try
TS! Etc. etc.

Now. Even _more_ interesting, is that many Matrices can be combined
into a single Matrix representing multiple transforms! This is done
via multiplication, and an important note here is that matrix
multiplication is not commutative, that is: `A*B != B*A`, so the
order in which you combine your matrices is important.

This can let you do things like, rotate around a pivot point, or
build a hierarchy of transforms! A parent/child position hierarchy
can be described pretty easily this way:
```csharp
Matrix parentTransform = Matrix.TR(10, 0, 0, Quat.FromAngles(0, 45, 0));
Matrix childTransform  = Matrix.TS( 1, 1, 0, 0.2f);

Mesh.Cube.Draw(Material.Default, parentTransform);
Mesh.Cube.Draw(Material.Default, childTransform * parentTransform);
```

![Combining matrices]({{site.screen_url}}/Drawing_MatrixCombine.jpg)
_The smaller `childTransform` is relative to `parentTransform` via multiplication._

## Models

The easiest way to draw complex content is through a Model! A Model
is basically a small scene of Mesh/Material pairs at positions with
hierarchical relationships to each other. If you're creating art in
a 3D modeling tool such as Blender, then this is basically a full
representation of the scene you've created there.

Since a model already has all its information within it, all you
need to do is provide it with a location!
```csharp
model.Draw(Matrix.T(10, 10, 0));
```
![Drawing a model]({{site.screen_url}}/Drawing_Model.jpg)
_StereoKit's main format is the .gltf file._

So... that was also pretty simple! The only real trick with Models
is getting one in the first place, but even that's not too hard.
There's a lot you can do with a Model beyond just drawing it, so
for more details on that, check out [the Model guide](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit/blob/master/Examples/StereoKitTest/Demos/DemoNodes.cs) (coming soon)!

But here's the quick list of where you can get a Model to begin
with:
 - [`Model.FromFile`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Model/FromFile.html) is the easiest, most common way to get a Model!
 - [`Model.FromMesh`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Model/FromMesh.html) will let you create a very simple Model with a single function call.
 - The [Model constructor]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Model/Model.html) lets you create an empty Model, which you can then fill with ModelNodes via [`Model.AddNode`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Model/AddNode.html)
 - You can call [`Model.Copy`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Model/Copy.html) to create a duplicate of an existing Model.

## Lines

Being able to easily draw a line is incredibly useful for
debugging, and generally quite practical for many other purposes as
well! StereoKit has the [`Lines`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Lines.html)
class to assist with this, and is pretty straightforward to use.
There's a few variations, but at it's simplest, it's a few points,
a color, and a thickness.
```csharp
Lines.Add(
	new Vec3(2, 2, 0),
	new Vec3(3, 2.5f, 0),
	Color.Black, 1*U.cm);
```
![Drawing a line]({{site.screen_url}}/Drawing_Lines.jpg)
_You can also draw Rays, Poses, and multicolored lists of lines!_

## Text

Text is drawn with a collection of rectangular quads, each mapped
to a character glyph on a texture. StereoKit supports rendering any
Unicode glyphs you throw at it, as long as the active Font has
that glyph defined in it! This means you can work with all sorts of
different languages right away, without any baking or preparation.

To draw text with the default Font, you can do this!
```csharp
Text.Add("こんにちは", Matrix.T(-10, 10,0));
```

![Drawing text]({{site.screen_url}}/Drawing_Text.jpg)
_'Hello' in Japanese, I'm pretty sure._

You can create additional font styles and fonts to use with text
drawing, and there are a number of overloads for [`Text.Add`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Text/Add.html)
that allow you to change the layout or constrain to a particular
area. Check the docs for the method for more information about that!

## Cool!

So that's the highlights! There's plenty more to draw and more
tricks to be learned, but this is a great start! There's treasures
in the documentation, so hunt around in there for more samples. You
