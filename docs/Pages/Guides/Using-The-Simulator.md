# Using the Simulator

As a developer, you can't realistically spend all of your development in
a headset just yet. So, a decent grasp over StereoKit's fallback
flatscreen MR simulator is particularly helpful! This is basically a 2D
window that allows you to move around and interact, without requiring an
OpenXR runtime or headset.

## Simulator Controls

When you start the simulator, you'll find that your mouse controls the
right hand by default. This is a complete simulation of an articulated
hand, so you'll have access to all the joints the same way you would a
real tracked hand. The hand becomes tracked when the mouse enters the
window, and untracked when leaving the window. The pointer ray, which is
normally a shoulder->hand ray, will be along the mouse ray instead.

### Mouse Controls:
- Left Mouse - Hand animates to a Pinch gesture.
- Right Mouse - Hand animates to a Grip gesture.
- Left + Right - Hand animates to a closed fist.
- Scroll Wheel - Moves the hand toward or away from the user.
- Shift + Right - Mouse-look / rotate the head.
- Left Alt - [Eye tracking](({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Input/Eyes.html) will point along the ray indicated by the mouse.

To move around in space, you'll find controls that should be familiar to
those that play first-person games! Hold Left Shift to enable this.

### Keyboard Controls:
- Shift+W - Move forward.
- Shift+A - Move left.
- Shift+S - Move backwards.
- Shift+D - Move right.
- Shift+Q - Move down.
- Shift+E - Move up.

## Simulator API

There's a few bits of functionality that let you set up the simulator, or
some features that may assist you in debugging or testing! Here's a
couple you may want to know about:

### Simulator Enable/Disable

By default, StereoKit will fall back to the flatscreen simulator if
OpenXR fails to initialize for any reason (like, headset not plugged in,
or OpenXR not present). You can modify this behavior at initialization
time when defining your SKSettings for SK.Init.
```csharp
SKSettings settings = new SKSettings {
	appName                = "Flatscreen Simulator",
	assetsFolder           = "Assets",
	// This tells StereoKit to always start in a 2D flatscreen
	// window, instead of an immersive MR environment.
	displayPreference      = DisplayMode.Flatscreen,
	// Setting this to true will disable all built-in MR simulator
	// controls.
	disableFlatscreenMRSim = false,
	// Setting this to true will prevent StereoKit from creating the
	// fallback simulator when OpenXR fails to initialize. This is
	// important when shipping a final application to users.
	noFlatscreenFallback   = true,
};
```

### Overriding Hands

A number of functions are present that can make unit test and
complex input simulation possible. For a full example of this,
the [DebugToolWindow](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit/blob/master/Examples/StereoKitTest/DebugToolWindow.cs)
in the Test project has a number of sample utilities for
recording and playing back input.

Overriding the hands is one important element that you may want
to do! [`Input.HandOverride`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Input/HandOverride.html)
will set the hand input to a very specific pose, and hold that
pose until you call `Input.HandOverride` again with a new pose,
or call [`Input.HandClearOverride`]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Input/HandClearOverride.html)
to restore control back to the user.
