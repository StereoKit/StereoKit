/**
 * This class implements a narrow-phase collision detection algorithm. This
 * algorithm uses the ISA-GJK algorithm. This
 * implementation is based on the implementation discussed in the book
 * "Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments" by Gino van den Bergen.
 * This method implements the Hybrid Technique for calculating the
 * penetration depth. The two objects are enlarged with a small margin. If
 * the object intersects in their margins, the penetration depth is quickly
 * computed using the GJK algorithm on the original objects (without margin).
 * If the original objects (without margin) intersect, we exit GJK and run
 * the SAT algorithm to get contacts and collision data.
