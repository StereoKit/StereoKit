/**
 * This class is used to compute the narrow-phase collision detection
 * between a sphere and a convex polyhedron. The sphere is basically a
 * point with a margin around it. The idea of this method is to use
 * the GJK algorithm first. If GJK reports that the two objects are
 * separated, we are done. If GJK reports that the objects are overlapping
 * in the sphere margin, GJK will also report a contact point and a contact
 * normal. However, if GJK reports that the object are in deep penetration
 * (the center of the sphere is inside the polyhedron) we run the SAT
 * algorithm to get the contact point and contact normal.
 * This is based on the "Robust Contact Creation for Physics Simulation"
 * presentation by Dirk Gregorius.
